I am a lecturer at the faculty of engineering and applied sciences at the [Cranfield University](https://profiles.cranfield.ac.uk/3240-venkatraman-renganathan), United Kingdom. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Automatic Control](https://control.lth.se) in Lund University, Sweden where I was hosted by Dr. Anders Rantzer. Earlier I obtained my PhD in [Mechanical Engineering](https://me.utdallas.edu) (with focus on Dynamics and Controls) on 2021 from The University of Texas at Dallas, USA under the supervision of Dr. Tyler Summers. I hold a Masters degree in [Electrical Engineering](https://ecee.engineering.asu.edu) (with focus on Control Systems) on 2016 from the Arizona State University, USA where I was mentored by Dr. Armando Rodriguez. I finished my undergraduate studies in [Electrical and Electronics Engineering](https://gct.ac.in/19/department-eee-about-department) from the Government College of Technology - Anna University in Coimbatore, India in 2011 with Dr. V. Prasanna Moorthy being my mentor.
