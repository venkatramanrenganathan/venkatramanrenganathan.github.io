Security of Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) is of great concern nowadays. My past research was about securiing CPS in face of distirbutional uncertainty using distributional robustness aproaches. My current research is about using purely data-driven approaches to arrive at decision making for raising alarms to secure CPS when anomalies affect them.
