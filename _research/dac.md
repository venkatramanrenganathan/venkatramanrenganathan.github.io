My current research is about analysing and designing adaptive controls for uncertain systems. The uncertainty in selecting the true dynamics from the known finite number of possible dynamics demands a learning based controller. One such controller is the famous minimax adaptive controller developed initially by Tamer Basar and further extended by Anders Rantzer. Earlier I analysed the regret of this controller to quantify the effort needed to overcome the lack of knowledge of true dynamics by the minimax adaptive controller. Further, I also explored the possibility of designing distributed version of the minimax adaptive controller to control uncertain networked systems. Currently, I am exploring the option of expanding the horizon of adaptive control in the network control setting with output model.
