Guaranteeing safe motion plans for robots is very important during critical robotic missions. My earlier research involved about coming up with motion plans that will work for uncertainties affecting the robot from any distribution satisfying first two moments. My current research is about investigating different non-uniform risk allocation procedures and design of learning based motion planning for robots in uncertain environments.
